//Plan: make an object(?) that passes data into a regex formula and ticks up a counter when the password/requirements combo works out
// const regex = /s/g  and stringVar.match(regex) is normal regex format to return an array with each s from the password
// ALL ELSE FAILS -> can make 26 if else statements with normal regex, but want to make all purpose regex that can parse information from the read file
