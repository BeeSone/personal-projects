own property -> defined directly on the instance object
prototype property -> defined beneath the instance of a referenced object, is 
                        searched for when a property is called and is not found in
                        the "own properties" of an object

myObj instanceof ObjConstructor; -> returns true if myObj was created using the ObjConstructor constructor.

.constructor returns the name of the constructor that was used to create the object referenced
    (although the proeprty constructor can be overriden)

When you initalize the prototype of an object seperately it is 
good to set the constructor property, as the constructor property automatically
is set to the value <Object> otherwise.
